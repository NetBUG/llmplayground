# LLM playground

I intend to gather some useful training scripts here

## Structure
 - `llm_assessment` folder contains the pipeline to assess the adequacy of the trained virtual assistant model
 - `llm_training` folder contains examples of models trained
 - `llm_inference` contains an example of inference setups
 - `infra` contains setups for building and deploying images
